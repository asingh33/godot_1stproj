# godot_1stproj
This is the first project using Godot game engine. In this project I am using a simple character movement and added my own jetpack effect.

Disclaimer: The player sprite is not created by me but was taken from one of the Godot tutorial. I just modified it to give it a girl look and cloth texture. [ToDo: Give credit to that tutorial project with link added.]

# Usage
Just import the project in Godot and it work as expected. I have tried it already on Mac and Windows.
Use the arrow keys to control the character.
